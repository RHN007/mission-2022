            Let’s imagine a developer’s life without limits. <br />
            What would we be able to accomplish if we were not victims of time
            pressure, blockers, inherited code bases, political games or
            economic distress?

          <p>
            It’s true – when you lend someone a helping hand, you feel a lot
            better about yourself, and you will likely learn something new.
            <br />
            Helping others feels so rewarding because you know that you have
            contributed something very important to humanity. And what better
            way to help your fellow developers than to join one of the many
            developer communities out there?
